# sb

`sb` is a CLI for managing qBittorrent instances via their web UIs. It is handy
for bulk operations, especially those that need to be coordinated across
multiple instances.

## Installation

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/t-mart/sb.git
```

## Config

Config in toml format is stored in `~/.config/sb/config.toml`.

```toml
[clients.aClient]
host = "http://localhost:8080"
username = "admin"
password = "adminadmin"

[clients.bClient]
host = "http://otherhost:8080"
username = "user"
password = "pass"
```

Clients identify instances of qBittorrent running the web UI. Each client has a
name (like `aClient` or `bClient` above) and connection details.

## Statuses

Many commands accept a `--status-filter` option to filter which torrents to
operate on.

The possible statuses are:

- `all`: All torrents, regardless of state. (This is the same as not providing a
  status filter at all.)
- `downloading`: Downloading data
- `seeding`: Uploading data
- `active`: Uploading or downloading data
- `inactive`: Neither uploading nor downloading data
- `completed`: All data locally present (not necessarily seeding)
- `stopped` or `paused`: Stopped by the user
- `running` or `resumed`: Not stopped by the user
- `stalled_uploading`: Not uploading
- `stalled_downloading`: Not downloading
- `stalled`: Not uploading nor downloading
- `checking`: Being checked
- `moving`: Being moved
- `errored`: In an error state
- `completed_stopped`: `stopped` and `completed`
- `downloading_stopped`: `stopped` and not `completed`

Note that many statuses are overlapping. For example, a torrent that is
`seeding` is also `active` and `running`.

## Categories

Many commands accept a `--category-filter` option to filter which torrents to
operate on.

If the client utilizes subcategories, they are selected when specifying the
parent category. For example, `--category-filter movies` will select torrents in
torrents with categories `movies`, `movies/foo`, and `movies/bar`.

Providing an empty string to `--category-filter` will select torrents with no
category. To select all torrents regardless of category, do not provide the
option at all.

## Subcommands

Many commands accept a `--dry-run` option to show what would be done without
making any changes.

The best documentation is the help text for each command. Run
`sb COMMAND --help` to see details.

### `add`

Add all torrent files provided to a client in a stopped state and start a
recheck on each newly-added torrent. Client may be a single client or many
separated by commas. One or more torrent files may be provided.

This is helpful when new torrents are created or downloaded and we want to add
them.

Has a `--delete-after` option to delete the torrent file after adding it
successfully to all provided clients.

Examples:

```sh
sb add aClient path/to/a.torrent
```

```sh
sb add aClient,bClient path/to/*.torrent --delete-after
```

### `cp`

Add all torrents from FROM_CLIENT to TO_CLIENT that do not already exist on
TO_CLIENT. Just like `add`, the torrents are added in a paused state and a
recheck is run after adding.

TO_CLIENT may be a single client or many separated by commas.

The category of the torrents on FROM_CLIENT is preserved when adding to
TO_CLIENT.

Examples:

```sh
sb cp aClient bClient
```

### `ls`

List all torrents in a given qbittorrent instance as JSON. May provide zero or
more hashes to select particular torrents.

May also provide torrent hashes to select particular torrents. Accepts a
`--status` option to filter which torrents to list.

Example:

```sh
sb ls aClient
```

```sh
sb ls aClient --status-filter seeding
```

```sh
sb ls aClient c5e4ca57a767df5cdda3866f43d224925a2a16ab
```

### `recheck`

Start a recheck on all torrents for client, which can be a single client or many
separated by commas.

Example:

```sh
sb recheck aClient --status-filter downloading_stopped
```

### `start`

Start all torrents for client, which can be a single client or many separated by
commas.

Example:

```sh
sb start aClient --status-filter completed_stopped
```

### `lsc`

List all configured clients as JSON.

Example:

```sh
sb lsc
```
